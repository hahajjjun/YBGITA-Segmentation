# Context Encoding for Semantic Segmentation

Can we leverage the context encoding of classic approaches with the power of deep learning?

## Previous approaches

- Deeplabv3: Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling

- PSPNet: Spatial Pyramid Pooling during upsampling

- Classical context encoding: Extraction of hand-engineered features -> visual vocabulary (dictionary) -> description of **feature statistics** with classic encoders

## Suggestion

1. *Context Encoding Module incorporating Semantic Encoding Loss (SE-loss)*

2. *Context Encoding Network (EncNet)*

## Structure

## Problem

FCN finds difficulty in capturing the context of the image

What if you see foreign objects in the scene?

did not bother much
